  abstract = {We study a class of simulated annealing algorithms for global
  minimization of a continuous function defined on a subset of Rd. We consider
  the case where the selection Markov kernel is absolutely continuous and has a
  density which is uniformly bounded away from 0. This class includes certain
  simulated annealing algorithms recently introduced by various authors. We
  show that, under mild conditions, the sequence of states generated by these
  algorithms converges in probability to the global minimum of the function.
  Unlike most previous studies where the cooling schedule is deterministic, our
  cooling schedule is allowed to be adaptive. We also address the issue of
  almost sure convergence versus convergence in probability.}

  function when skilled and unskilled labor are imperfect substitutes. We find
  that there is a skill bias in cross-country technology differences.
  Higher-income countries use skilled labor more efficiently than lower-income
  countries, while they use unskilled labor relatively and, possibly,
  absolutely less efficiently. We also propose a simple explanation for our
  findings: rich countries, which are skilled-labor abundant, choose
  technologies that are best suited to skilled workers; poor countries, which
  are unskilled-labor abundant, choose technologies more appropriate to
  unskilled workers. We discuss alternative explanations, such as capital-skill
  complementarity and differences in schooling quality.}

  abstract = {We describe a new package, UNCMIN, for finding a local minimizer
  of a real valued function of more than one variable. The novel feature of
  UNCMIN is that it is a modular system of algorithms, containing three
  different step selection strategies (line search, dogleg, and optimal step)
  that may be combined with either analytic or finite difference gradient
  evaluation and with either analytic, finite difference, or BFGS Hessian
  approximation. We present the results of a comparison of the three step
  selection strategies on the problems in More, Garbow, and Hillstrom in two
  separate cases: using finite difference gradients and Hessians, and using
  finite difference gradients with BFGS Hessian approximations. We also
  describe a second package, REVMIN, that uses optimization algorithms
  identical to UNCMIN but obtains values of user-supplied functions by reverse
  communication.}

  increasing application to many types of extremization problems. Three of
  these procedures are analyzed and their underlying theoretical similarities
  are pointed out. It is shown that the Davidon-Fletcher-Powell, conjugate
  gradient, and gradient partan methods provide identical results when applied
  to a quadratic cost function. This occurs because each procedure generates
  the same set of mutually conjugate vectors and is the basic reason for their
  quadratic convergence property. A slight modification to the conjugate
  gradient procedure proposed by Fletcher and Reeves is seen to yield a
  procedure that exhibits the principal property of the Davidon-Fletcher-Powell
  method when applied to nonquadratic cost functions. This modified conjugate
  gradient procedure involves a significantly smaller amount of computation
  than either the Davidon-Fletcher-Powell or gradient partan methods while
  retaining the basic properties influencing convergence of the
  Davidon-Fletcher-Powell procedure.}
