  abstract = {We study a class of simulated annealing algorithms for global
  minimization of a continuous function defined on a subset of Rd. We consider
  the case where the selection Markov kernel is absolutely continuous and has a
  density which is uniformly bounded away from 0. This class includes certain
  simulated annealing algorithms recently introduced by various authors. We
  show that, under mild conditions, the sequence of states generated by these
  algorithms converges in probability to the global minimum of the function.
  Unlike most previous studies where the cooling schedule is deterministic, our
  cooling schedule is allowed to be adaptive. We also address the issue of
  almost sure convergence versus convergence in probability.}

  Higher-income countries use skilled labor more efficiently than lower-income
  countries, while they use unskilled labor relatively and, possibly,
  absolutely less efficiently. We also propose a simple explanation for our
  findings: rich countries, which are skilled-labor abundant, choose
  technologies that are best suited to skilled workers; poor countries, which
  are unskilled-labor abundant, choose technologies more appropriate to
  unskilled workers. We discuss alternative explanations, such as capital-skill
  complementarity and differences in schooling quality.}

  replacing the commonly used Cobb-Douglas (CD) aggregated production
  specification with the more general Constant-Elasticity-of-Substitution (CES)
  specification. We first justify our choice of production function by showing
  that cross-country regressions favour the CES over the CD technology. Then,
  by using an endogenous threshold methodology we show that the Solow model
  with CES technology is consistent with the existence of multiple regimes.}

  that may be combined with either analytic or finite difference gradient
  evaluation and with either analytic, finite difference, or BFGS Hessian
  approximation. We present the results of a comparison of the three step
  selection strategies on the problems in More, Garbow, and Hillstrom in two
  separate cases: using finite difference gradients and Hessians, and using
  finite difference gradients with BFGS Hessian approximations. We also
  describe a second package, REVMIN, that uses optimization algorithms
  identical to UNCMIN but obtains values of user-supplied functions by reverse

  the same set of mutually conjugate vectors and is the basic reason for their
  quadratic convergence property. A slight modification to the conjugate
  gradient procedure proposed by Fletcher and Reeves is seen to yield a
  procedure that exhibits the principal property of the Davidon-Fletcher-Powell

  abstract = {Most empirical work in economic growth assumes either a
  Cobb-Douglas production function expressed in logs or a log-approximated
  constant elasticity of substitution specification. Estimates from each are
  likely biased due to logging the model and the latter can also suffer from
  approximation bias. We illustrate this with a successful replication of
  Masanjala and Papagerogiou (The Solow model with CES technology:
  nonlinearities and parameter heterogeneity, Journal of Applied Econometrics
  2004; 19: 171-201) and then estimate both models in levels to avoid these
  biases. Our estimation in levels gives results in line with conventional
  wisdom.}
